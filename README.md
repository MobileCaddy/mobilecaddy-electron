# MobileCaddy Electron Support Package

Basic package that adds support for creating desktop apps for Salesforce using the [MobileCaddy](https://mobilecaddy.net) package.

See our [starter app](https://github.com/mobilecaddy/mobilecaddy-electron-starter) for an example app

Install with;
```
npm install --save mobilecaddy-electron
```

## Testing

```
npm run test
```

This runs up an electron app, from the _test_ dir. Uses test config and creates DB etc in that directory too
